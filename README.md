# StuRevu
Third Level Education is a big investment of time and money. StuRevu aims to help in mitigating this risk.
We believe that with peer recommendations and reviews prospective students can gain insight and make better decisions when choosing their Education.

Students past and present sharing knowledge.
Help others by sharing information and advice in reviews and by replying to comments to answer questions and queries.

Colleges, Courses, Modules and Clubs & Societies
The idea is to create an independent online database of Education related information that can be accessed on mobile devices.

StuRevu allows you to compare the ratings of different third level providers based on the opinions and word of mouth advice of current and past students.

A simple, consistent user interface allows you to intuitively navigate and explore.
Quickly and easily return to your favourites and receive updates of new reviews and comments.

Browse reviews and add comments for more info.
Add any type of College, Course, Module, Club or Society

Sturevu is a Data Driven Android App that collects and displays
reviews of Third Level Institutions and Courses.

Prospective Students can gain access to the collective
knowledge and experience of thousands of current students
and graduates. They can use the App as a comparison tool
when deciding on where and what to study.

This will hopefully result in higher progression and graduate
employment rates from informed decision making in choosing
courses and improvements in education quality from
transparent feedback.
